### userscripts

***

#### [reddit-filter.user.js](reddit-filter.user.js)
Inspired by Reddit Filter plus - this script opens up a modal dialog that allows you to create rules for hiding posts
based on subreddit, title, URL, or user. Title rules use exact match and are thus case-sensitive. All changes, including
rule deletions, are only saved after explicitly clicking the save button.

#### [reddit-remove-read-next.user.js](reddit-remove-read-next.user.js)
Removes the annoying read next popup in the lower right corner that shows when you scroll down a post's comments

#### [reddit-toggle-custom-css.user.js](reddit-toggle-custom-css.user.js)
Adds a small checkbox under the subreddit name in the right column, which allows for toggling of a subreddit's custom
CSS

Custom subreddit CSS is always disabled by default. This script is primarily meant for use with custom userstyles for
those who don't have a Reddit account and therefore don't have access to the option for disabling custom CSS.

#### [youtube-better-frontpage.user.js](youtube-better-frontpage.user.js)
No more garbage on the front page
