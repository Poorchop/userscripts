### userscripts

***

#### [reddit-filter.user.js](reddit-filter.user.js)
Inspired by Reddit Filter plus - this script opens up a modal dialog that allows you to create rules for hiding posts
based on subreddit, title, URL, or user. Title rules are case-sensitive and may match all or part of a string; a rule of
"Cow Del" will match "SuperCow Deluxe" for example, but not "Supercow Deluxe". All changes, including rule deletions,
are only saved after explicitly clicking the save button.

Buttons are also added to the bottom of the page for toggling the hiding and highlighting of filtered posts.

#### [reddit-remove-read-next.user.js](reddit-remove-read-next.user.js)
Removes the annoying read next popup in the lower right corner that shows when you scroll down a post's comments

#### [reddit-toggle-custom-css.user.js](reddit-toggle-custom-css.user.js)
Adds a small checkbox under the subreddit name in the right column, which allows for toggling of a subreddit's custom
CSS

Custom subreddit CSS is always disabled by default. This script is primarily meant for use with custom userstyles for
those who don't have a Reddit account and therefore don't have access to the option for disabling custom CSS.

#### [youtube-better-frontpage.user.js](youtube-better-frontpage.user.js)
No more garbage on the front page
Thanks to [Farow](https://github.com/Farow) for the script
